Code Clause Internship Project 1  

This repository contains code for an object detection system that uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm through the Ultranalytics library and cvzone library to detect objects in images and videos with high accuracy. The system supports detection from photos, videos and webcam.

## Requirements
To run this code, you will need to have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- Ultranalytics
- cvzone

You can install these libraries by running the following command in your terminal:
```
 pip install ultralytics cvzone
```
